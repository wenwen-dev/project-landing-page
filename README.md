# project-landing-page

This is a project assignment of The Odin Project.

The goal is to create a webpage based on the design file given. The purpose is to practice HTML CSS basics, esp. Flexbox.

Upon completion: what I learnt:
Approach: complete one section and the next, top down is good. Get the html (structure) on there first, and then style it.
Using padding to style how condensed a section it.
Color picker Chrome extension is a great tool to find exact color on any webpage.

To Do:
Hardly used any flex properties (grow, shrink, basis), and I need to find practice.
